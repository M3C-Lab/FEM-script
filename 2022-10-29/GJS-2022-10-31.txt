Summary of work:
1. modify the paper manusrcipt and add the the introduction part
2. implement the coding work of multipatch-EM version of elastodynamics
3. did a perturbation research compared with existing methods
4. made a presentation of the introduction of YAML file and Master-Slave BC 

Literature review:
1. chaos: 
Sansour et al [1] applied a energy-momentum time scheme to study the chaotic motions of shells.
The authors showed that the scheme could capture the character of chaos for nonlinear systems. But the author didn't
distinguish between his method and other methods in chaos study.
Xie et al [2] investigate the instability and chaos of the Newmark methods for nonliear dynamic equations. The author
showed that improper choose of time steps and some initial parameters may lead to chaos in nonliear systems by using the
Trapezoidal rule of Newmark method. The author then modified the scheme to be a energy conserving scheme, and no chaos occur
again. 

2. time schemes and incompressible elastodyanmics:
The introduction part of the paper.
